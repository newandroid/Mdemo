/**
 * A thread-safe Watcher for transitioning states in operators.
 * <p>
 * Allows both single-threaded and multi-threaded execution controlled by the following FastProperty:
 * <li>reactive.watcher.multithreaded.enabled [Default: false]</li>
 * <p>
 * Single-threaded Execution rules are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Allow only single-threaded, synchronous, ordered execution of onNext, onCompleted, onError</li>
 * <li>Once an onComplete or onError are performed, no further calls can be executed</li>
 * <li>If unsubscribe is called, this means we call completed() and don't allow any further onNext calls.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Multi-threaded Execution rules are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Allows multiple threads to perform onNext concurrently</li>
 * <li>When an onComplete, onError or unsubscribe request is received, block until all current onNext calls are completed</li>
 * <li>When an unsubscribe is received, block until all current onNext are completed</li>
 * <li>Once an onComplete or onError are performed, no further calls can be executed</li>
 * <li>If unsubscribe is called, this means we call completed() and don't allow any further onNext calls.</li>
