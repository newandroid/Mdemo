     * A Watcher must call a Watchable's <code>subscribe</code> method in order to register itself
     * to receive push-based notifications from the Watchable. A typical implementation of the
     * <code>subscribe</code> method does the following:
     * 
     * It stores a reference to the Watcher in a collection object, such as a <code>List<T></code>
     * object.
     * 
     * It returns a reference to an <code>WatchableSubscription</code> interface. This enables
     * Watchers to unsubscribe (that is, to stop receiving notifications) before the Watchable has
     * finished sending them and has called the Watcher's <code>OnCompleted</code> method.
     * 
     * At any given time, a particular instance of an <code>Watchable<T></code> implementation is
     * responsible for accepting all subscriptions and notifying all subscribers. Unless the
     * documentation for a particular <code>Watchable<T></code> implementation indicates otherwise,
     * Watchers should make no assumptions about the <code>Watchable<T></code> implementation, such
     * as the order of notifications that multiple Watchers will receive.
