	<p>A library that enables subscribing to and composing asynchronous events and
		callbacks.</p>
	<p>The Watchable/Watcher interfaces and associated operators (in
		the .operations package) are inspired by and attempt to conform to the
		Reactive Rx library in Microsoft .Net.</p>
	<p>

	<p>Compared with the Microsoft implementation:
	<ul>
		<li>Watchable == IObservable</li>
		<li>Watcher == IObserver</li>
		<li>WatchableSubscription == IDisposable</li>
		<li>WatchableExtensions == Observable</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>Services which intend on exposing data asynchronously and wish
		to allow reactive processing and composition can implement the
		Watchable interface which then allows Watchers to subscribe to them
		and receive events.</p>
	<p>Usage examples can be found on the Watchable and Watcher
		classes.</p>
